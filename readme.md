#### C Version

C code is available in `c_version/`.  A `makefile` is provided that specifies how to build the various parts of the project.  You can build the demo using:

`make kaprekarDemo`

and then run it from the command line using

`./kaprekarDemo 297`

An ad-hoc testing program has been provided as well which can be built using

`make kaprekarTest`

and then run it from the command line using

`./kaprekarTest`

Only after you have corrected all of the problems (both syntax errors as well as logic errors) will everything compile and the test suite reach 100%
